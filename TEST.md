# Testing Web Automation Tools

This document outlines the testing procedures for our web automation tools.

## Unit Tests

Each tool (Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium) has its own set of unit tests. To run these tests:

1. Navigate to the tool's directory.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the test command (e.g., `npm test` or `python -m unittest`).

## Integration Tests

Integration tests ensure that our tools work correctly with various web applications. To run these tests:

1. Set up the test environment as described in the README.md.
2. Run the integration test suite: `npm run integration-tests`.

## End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios across different browsers and platforms. To run these tests:

1. Ensure you have the necessary browsers installed.
2. Set up the test environment as described in the README.md.
3. Run the e2e test suite: `npm run e2e-tests`.

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Every pull request triggers our CI pipeline, which runs all tests across different operating systems and browsers.

## Adding New Tests

When adding new features or fixing bugs:

1. Add appropriate unit tests.
2. Update integration tests if necessary.
3. Consider adding new e2e tests for significant features.
4. Ensure all existing tests pass with your changes.

Remember, good tests are essential for maintaining the quality and reliability of our tools!
